**Intro**
  
This is a Project that allows a user to create a profile and add pictures to that profile. They can add images, enter their name and give themselves a description. 

This project is to learn how to accomadate different device screen sizes between 620 and 1280 pixels and that the elements are displayed correctly.

**Images**  
  
The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

This is the first iteration for review.
